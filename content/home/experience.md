  - title: Robotics Engineer
    company: ADLINK
    company_url: 'https://www.adlinktech.com/en/index'
    location: Taipei, Taiwan
    date_start: '2020-06-01'
    date_end: '2020-08-14'
    description: |2-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Built mobile robot running under either ROS (Robot Operating System) or ROS2.
        * Simulated the robot with Gazebo to save time and evaluate the function I built.
        * Implemented LOAM (LiDAR Odometry and Mapping in Real-time) and UKF (Unscented Kalman Filter) with a Velodyneâ€™s LiDAR, VLP-16, to lower the localization error of AMCL (Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization).
        * Accelerated AMCL with GPU by 30% while the pose error is about 50% less.
        * Replaced TEB (Timed Elastic Band) with DWA (Dynamic Window Approach) as the controller to rise the success rate of navigation by 20%.

    description: |2-
        Responsibilities include:
        
        * Built an AGV (Automated guided vehicle) and implemented the system on ROS to deliver items in a hotel.
        * Generated the map with gmapping, laser-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization And Mapping).
        * Localized the robot with AMCL and 2D LiDAR, RPLiDAR, while the initial pose is defined by AprialTag scanned by an RGB camera.
