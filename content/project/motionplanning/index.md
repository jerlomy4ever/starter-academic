## Abstract
Computed a collision-free path for a robotâ€™s arm with RRT* (rapidly-exploring random tree star) such that the arm
reaches the goal without hitting any obstacle. Created a plugin for OpenRAVE in C++ to accelerate.

The code repository is [here](https://github.com/jerlomy4ever/EECS598_MotionPlanning/blob/main/hw03/my_solution/myplugin.cpp).
